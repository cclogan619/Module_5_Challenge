You’ll make an API call to Alpaca via the Alpaca SDK to get the current closing prices of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker: SPY) and of the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (ticker: AGG). For the prototype, assume that the member holds 110 shares of SPY, which represents the stock portion of their portfolio, and 200 shares of AGG, which represents the bond portion. To do all this, complete the following steps:\n",
